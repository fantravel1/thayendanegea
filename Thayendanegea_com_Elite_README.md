# Thayendanegea.com --- Elite Mega-Site Blueprint (README)

## A Visual, Powerful, Respectful Digital Home for Thayendanegea (Joseph Brant) and the Living Haudenosaunee World

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Executive Vision

**Thayendanegea.com** becomes an *experience-first* historical megasite:
part interactive museum, part map atlas, part language & culture
gateway, part biography engine---built with **Indigenous respect**,
scholarly rigor, and modern storytelling.

This is not a "colonial history page."\
This is not a one-sided hero story.\
This is a living, multi-perspective platform that helps people
understand:

-   the person (Thayendanegea / Joseph Brant)
-   the political world he navigated
-   Haudenosaunee confederacy context
-   diplomacy, war, displacement, survival
-   modern legacy & memory (including controversy and nuance)
-   places you can visit today (maps, markers, memorials)

**Goal:** make the site so visually compelling and structured that it
becomes the default global reference.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1) Category Definition

## Thayendanegea.com

### "A Living Biography + Atlas + Source Library"

Most resources are either: - too academic (hard to access), or - too
simplified (missing context), or - too colonial (missing Haudenosaunee
framing)

Thayendanegea.com unifies:

-   biography
-   timeline
-   geography (maps)
-   diplomacy network
-   primary sources and codex-like documents
-   language context (Mohawk / Kanien'kéha notes)
-   memory & monuments
-   modern community connections

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2) The Spectacular Homepage (Crown Jewel)

## Hero Experience: "Choose Your Lens"

Homepage presents 4 big entry doors:

1.  **The Man** (Biography & Character)
2.  **The World** (Haudenosaunee + 1700s geopolitics)
3.  **The Map** (Places, routes, settlements, memorials)
4.  **The Sources** (Letters, portraits, speeches, records)

### The homepage also features a "scroll museum":

-   A cinematic vertical experience with artifacts (portraits, maps,
    plaques)
-   Each scroll stop reveals a short, clear "what matters" caption
-   Click expands into deep content

Primary CTA: **Explore the Atlas**\
Secondary CTA: **Start the Timeline**\
Tertiary CTA: **Read the Biography**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3) Core Pillar: The Interactive Atlas

## A) Places That Built the Story

A map-first interface that lets people explore: - Mohawk Valley roots
and sites - battle geography and movement - diplomatic journeys - Grand
River / Six Nations settlement regions - memorial sites and markers

### Map toggles

-   Time period slider
-   Political boundaries
-   Travel routes
-   "Conflict zones" vs "Diplomacy zones"
-   "Living communities today" layer (carefully framed)

### Each map pin opens a rich "Place Page"

-   why the place matters
-   what happened there (timeline-linked)
-   images / artifacts / quotes
-   "visit today" info when appropriate

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4) Core Pillar: The Timeline Engine

## A visual timeline with "decision points"

Instead of just dates, the timeline highlights: - pivotal alliances -
turning points in diplomacy - major moments of displacement - shifts in
Haudenosaunee politics - treaty and land-claim context (as appropriate)

Each node includes: - 1-paragraph "what happened" - 3-bullet "why it
matters" - linked sources - linked map pins - "perspectives" tab
(multiple interpretations)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5) Core Pillar: The Biography as a Story System

## The biography is modular and cinematic

Chapters built like a docuseries: - Origins & education - Translating
worlds (language, religion, diplomacy) - War years (without glorifying
violence) - Post-war displacement and rebuilding - Land, treaties, and
political struggle - Legacy, memory, and debate

Each chapter includes: - artifact gallery - character network - "myths
vs documented facts" section - recommended books + museum links

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6) Core Pillar: Network of People (Diplomacy Graph)

An interactive "relationship map" showing: - allied leaders - British
officials - colonial counterparts - Haudenosaunee political network -
family ties (including influential relatives)

Each person node includes: - 3-minute biography - how they intersected
with Thayendanegea - key letters/events connecting them

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 7) Core Pillar: Language & Naming (Respectful + Useful)

A dedicated section that: - explains the name "Thayendanegea" -
clarifies why "Joseph Brant" appears in English sources - provides
pronunciation guidance (audio where possible) - includes a small
Kanien'kéha (Mohawk) learning module: - greetings - place names - key
terms used in historical context

Important: language content should be built with community consultation
and cited sources.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 8) Core Pillar: Monuments, Memory, and Modern Legacy

A structured, respectful archive of: - plaques and memorial texts -
statues / monuments (with context) - controversies and changing
interpretations - how communities remember and debate legacy today

This is where the site becomes *powerful*: - it doesn't flatten
complexity - it teaches how history is written, framed, and revised

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 9) Artifact & Source Library (The Authority Moat)

A "Source Vault" that includes: - portraits and prints - letters
(transcriptions where permitted) - plaques and historic markers - key
excerpts from reputable encyclopedias and museums - structured
bibliography (beginner → advanced)

Every item gets: - provenance - date - repository / museum / archive -
context summary - "how to interpret this responsibly" note

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 10) Interactive Features That Make It Addictive

## A) "Build the Timeline from the Map"

Users click a place and the site auto-builds the connected events
timeline.

## B) "Three Lenses Mode"

Every major page can be toggled: - **Community lens** (Indigenous
framing and values) - **Historical lens** (documented chronology) -
**Systems lens** (geopolitics, incentives, outcomes)

## C) "Teach Me in 7 Minutes"

A daily micro-lesson: - one artifact - one place - one concept - one
reflection question

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 11) SEO/AEO Scale Plan

This site can scale to thousands of evergreen pages:

-   every place pin becomes an indexed page
-   every person node becomes a biography page
-   every artifact becomes a searchable page
-   every concept (Haudenosaunee confederacy, wampum, diplomacy, etc.)
    becomes an explainer

Long-tail examples: - "Thayendanegea biography" - "Joseph Brant Mohawk
leader" - "Six Nations Grand River history" - "Thayendanegea memorial
plaque" - "Mohawk Valley 1700s diplomacy"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 12) Brand & Design System (Make it Visual)

Aesthetic direction: - museum-grade typography - artifact-led layout
(images first, text second) - warm, grounded palette (earth / parchment
/ ink) - map-first navigation - short captions → deep expansions

Key rule: **Make every page feel like a gallery wall.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 13) Ethics & Respect Commitments

-   No exoticizing
-   No "noble savage" framing
-   No violence glamorization
-   Contextualize colonial sources
-   Include living Haudenosaunee communities respectfully
