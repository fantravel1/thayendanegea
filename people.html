            <h4>Thayendanegea's Position</h4>
            <p style="font-size: var(--text-sm); color: var(--color-walnut);">
              Thayendanegea was a <strong>war chief</strong>, not a sachem. This distinction matters — he had military authority and diplomatic influence, but did not hold a hereditary council seat. Some of his critics within the Confederacy argued he overstepped the boundaries of his role, particularly in making land decisions.

            <h4>Influence on US Constitution</h4>
            <p style="font-size: var(--text-sm); color: var(--color-walnut);">
              Scholars have documented that the Haudenosaunee system influenced the framers of the US Constitution — particularly Benjamin Franklin, who observed Confederacy councils. The concepts of federalism, separation of powers, and representative governance all have Haudenosaunee parallels.
